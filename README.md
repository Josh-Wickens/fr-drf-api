Football Reaction is the perfect place for football fans to come together on one platform and speak just about football. Football reaction gives users the chance to state if they are a fan or if they are a club. They can make posts or join in conversations regarding certain topics and communicate together and share opinions. This repository is the backend of Football Reaction using Django REST Framework for the API database.

FIXED

- I had an bug when I created my like model and tried to create it so that you could like a post or post in topics.

To solve this I created a model for each post and comment so that it would seperate them and provide ID's for all comments and posts from the profile.

- I had a long error when I tried to set up the query to count all the posts in topics. After speaking to Tutor support Ger explained to me that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
